The characters of Ignorance and Want, introduced by the Ghost of Christmas Present, highlight the systemic neglect and social issues caused by an unequal distribution of resources.

**7. Reflection on the Past**

Scroogeâ€™s transformation is deeply tied to his reflections on the past, prompted by the Ghost of Christmas Past.

These poignant memories elicit regret and sorrow but also serve as critical motivators for his change [Data: Reports (2, 12, 14)].
