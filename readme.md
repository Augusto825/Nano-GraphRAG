üò≠ [GraphRAG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16130) is good and powerful, but the official [implementation](https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag/tree/main) is difficult/painful to read or hack.

üòä This project provides a simple GraphRAG implementation with minimal(ish?) dependencies.

üéÅ `nano-graphrag` is about 700 lines of code, excluding `tests` and prompts. 

üëå Small yet scalable. Fully asynchronous. You can switch any component you want!

## Install

**Install from PyPi**

```shell
pip install nano-graphrag
```

**Install from source**

```shell
# clone this repo first
cd nano-graphrag
pip install -e .
```



## Quick Start - Not yet

download a copy of A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens:

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gusye1234/nano-graphrag/main/tests/mock_data.txt > ./book.txt
```

Use the below python snippet:

```python
from nano_graphrag import GraphRAG

graph_func = GraphRAG(working_dir="./dickens")

with open("./book.txt") as f
    graph_func.insert(f.read())

print(graph_func.query("What are the top themes in this story?"))
```

Next time you initialize a `GraphRAG` from the same `working_dir`, it will reload all the contexts automatically.

### Async Support

For each method `NAME(...)` , there is a corresponding async method `aNAME(...)`

```python
await graph_func.ainsert(...)
await graph_func.aquery(...)
...
```



## Advanced:  Storage

You can replace all storage-related components to your own implementation, `nano-graphrag` mainly uses three kinds of storage:

- `base.BaseKVStorage` for storing key-json pairs of data. 
  - By default we use disk file storage as the backend. 
  -  `GraphRAG(.., key_string_value_json_storage_cls=YOURS,...)`
- `base.BaseVectorStorage` for indexing embeddings. 
  - By default we use [`milvus-lite`](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus-lite) as the backend.
  - `GraphRAG(.., vector_db_storage_cls=YOURS,...)`
- `base.BaseGraphStorage` for storing knowledge graph. 
  - By default we use [`networkx`](https://github.com/networkx/networkx) as the backend.
  - `GraphRAG(.., graph_storage_cls=YOURS,...)`
